Only Python 2 is supported at the moment, however modifications should
be easy to do.

Dependencies:
-------------
-Python 2
-Numpy
-Scipy
-Matplotlib

Installation:
-------------
Using the usual procedure:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install (be sure that the python executable is Python 2)

Uninstallation:
---------------
if you use pip you can uninstall doing:

pip uninstall meet

Version Compatibility:
----------------------
I try to avoid incompatibilities when updating functions,
this however cannot be totaly avoided from time to time. However
functions are thoroughly tested.
